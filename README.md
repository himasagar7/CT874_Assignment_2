Programming I Assignment 2

1.	The IT125 Coffee Company, offers discounts to volume buyers. The discounts are based on the table below: 

Order Volume	Discount
	
≥ 25 Bags	5%
	
≥ 50 Bags	10%
	
≥ 100 Bags	15%
	
≥ 150 Bags	20%
	
≥ 200 Bags	25%
	
≥ 300 Bags	30%
	


Each bag of coffee costs €5.50. 
Write an application that accepts the nmber of bags ordered and displays the number of bags ordered, 
the discount given and the total cost of the order. The output should resemble the screenshot below.




















2.	Write a program that replies either Leap Year of Not a Leap Year when given a year.
It is a leap year if the year is divisible by 4 but not by 100 (i.e. 1796 is a leap year because it is divisible by 4 but not by 100). A year that is divisible by both 4 and 100 is a leap year if it is also divisible by 400 (i.e. 2000 is a leap year but 1800 is not).
